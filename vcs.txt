- What is version Control System (VCS)?
    - VCS is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.
    - It is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code
    - They are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time
    - Keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of data

    - There are Two Types of VCS
        - Centralized version control system (CVCS)
        - Distributed version control system (DVCS)
    
    - Centralized VCS
    ```````````````````
        - In subversion CVS, perforce etc. A central server repository holds the "official copy" of th code.
        - The server maintains the sole version history copy.
        - You make "checkout" of it to your local copy
        - You make local modification.
        - You changes are not versioned.
        - When your's done, you "check in" back to the server.
        - You check in increments the repo's version.

        - Advantages and Disadvantages of CVCS
        ``````````````````````````````````````````````
            - Advantages:
                - Relatively easy Setup.
                - Provides transparency.
                - Enable admins control the workflow.

            - Disadvantages:
                - If the main server goes down, developers can's save versioned changes.
                - Remote commits are slow. 
                - Unsolicited changes might ruin development.
                - if the central database is corrupted is corrupted, the entire history could be lost(Security issues).

    - Distributed VCS
    ``````````````````
        - In git, mercurial, etc... you don't "Checkout" from a central repo.
        - You "Clone" it and "Pull" changes from it 
        - Your local repo is a complete copy of everything on the remote server.
        - Your's is "just as good" as theirs 
        - Many operations are local.
        - Check in/out from local repo
        - Commit changes to local repo
        - Local repo keeps version history
        - When repo keeps version history
        - Whey you're ready, you can "push" changes back to server.

        - Advantages DVCS
            - Allows developers to work simultaneously
            - Does not allow overwriting each other's changes.
            - Maintains a history of every version
            - Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software
            - Managing and protection the source code.
            - Supports the developer's workflow and not any rigid way of working.
            - Backup
            - CI/Cd
            - Integration in development tools.
